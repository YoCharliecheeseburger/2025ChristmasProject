    >>> Pixel font to fit style? Or christmas themed font


    Ideas:
    ~5-ish places with their characters:
    > Snow factory, one ginormous Yeti yapping about snow
      > https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzgzNDM4MzMucG5n/original/n51tYn.png

    > hot chocolate brewery (lab looking type), Gerardas as a chocolate brewer
      > https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/vibrant-futuristic-laboratory-filled-glowing-equipment-two-scientists-white-coats-working-meticulously-scene-361251732.jpg

    > Elf school, Giedrius as tall student elf waiting for his time to get employed in the present factory, background characters with minimal text
    > Present factory, most industrial looking place with overworked elves
      > https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/031/267/137/large/fedyunin_albert-.jpg?1603124265

    > Santa's Home, Robert is Santa

    > bad children prison, literally a coal mine with little snowmen with pickaxes out of ice

    for christmas lights ^^

      Add Christmas decorations to some of those (Hanging socks, big candy canes, tracks of snow, gifts)
    possibility to pixel art the characters instead of AI
